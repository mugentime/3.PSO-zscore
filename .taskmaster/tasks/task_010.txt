# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create genetic algorithm optimizer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build genetic algorithm optimization framework for strategy parameter tuning
# Details:
Implement genetic algorithm with crossover and mutation operations, create fitness functions for trading metrics, build population management and selection mechanisms, add elitism to preserve best performers, implement adaptive mutation rates, create convergence detection algorithms

# Test Strategy:
Test evolution across multiple generations, verify fitness improvements, compare results with Bayesian optimization
