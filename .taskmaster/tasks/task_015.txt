# Task ID: 15
# Title: Create capital scaling pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build progressive capital scaling system from micro to full deployment
# Details:
Create graduation criteria for capital scaling phases, implement performance validation checkpoints, build risk metrics monitoring for each phase, add capital allocation algorithms, create rollback mechanisms for underperformance, implement detailed reporting for each scaling phase

# Test Strategy:
Test graduation criteria triggers, verify capital scaling follows rules, confirm rollback mechanisms work
