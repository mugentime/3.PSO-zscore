# PSO+Zscore Railway Deployment Fix Plan

## Current Issue
All deployments failing during build process with: "Failed to build an image"

## Error History & Solutions

### Attempt 1: Docker Build Failures
**Error:** Railway can't find or build the Docker image
**Root Causes:**
1. Railway.json pointing to wrong Dockerfile path
2. Missing backend/requirements.txt in build context
3. Port binding issues

**Solutions Applied:**
- Fixed railway.json to use root Dockerfile
- Updated CMD to use ${PORT:-8000}
- Removed railway login from Dockerfile

### Current Dockerfile Issues
1. Using `backend/requirements.txt` but Railway might not have proper context
2. Missing health check endpoint verification
3. No explicit Python path setup

## Fix Strategy

### Step 1: Simplified Dockerfile
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY backend/requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY backend/ .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### Step 2: Railway Configuration
- Ensure railway.json points to root Dockerfile
- Set PORT environment variable in Railway dashboard
- Verify GitHub integration is active

### Step 3: Requirements Check
- Ensure all dependencies are in requirements.txt
- No version conflicts
- All imports resolvable

### Step 4: Health Check
- Verify /health endpoint exists and returns 200
- Add startup logging to debug

## Implementation Order
1. Update Dockerfile with simplified version
2. Commit and push to trigger deployment
3. Monitor Railway build logs
4. If fails, check specific error and iterate
5. Once build succeeds, verify health check
6. Test live endpoints

## Monitoring Loop
```
While deployment_failed:
    1. Check Railway build logs
    2. Identify specific error
    3. Fix in code
    4. Push to GitHub
    5. Wait for auto-deploy
    6. Check status
```

## Common Railway Issues & Fixes
- **Build context missing files**: Use COPY with full paths
- **Port binding**: Use PORT env var, not hardcoded
- **Memory issues**: Add build limits
- **Dependencies fail**: Use --no-cache-dir
- **Health check timeout**: Increase timeout in railway.toml
